                    Our plant-based meats are made with intention. By combining expert innovation with simple, non GMO ingredients, we deliver the meaty experience you crave without the compromise. Our products offer greater or equal protein levels than their animal counterparts, no cholesterol, less saturated fat, and no antibiotics or hormones.

                    A peer-reviewed Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) conducted by the University of Michigan compared the environmental impact of the Beyond Burger to a ¼ lb. U.S. beef burger. The result? A Beyond Burger uses significantly less water, land, energy, and generates fewer Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) than a beef burger.

                    What's the most effective way to reduce your environmental footprint? We'll give you a hint: It starts with your plate. That's right -- adjusting your diet can be better than getting solar panels, driving an electric car, or avoiding plastic straws. That's where Impossible Foods comes in. We make delicious meat, fish, and dairy products, from plants, so you can eat what you love, and save the planet that you love. Small actions lead to big change. </p>

                    The best way to reduce your carbon footprint, limit global warming, halt the collapse of biodiversity, save wildlife and ensure enough clean water for all of us is to ditch meat from animals. The good news is, you can replace it with something that tastes just as delicious. Use our environmental impact calculator to understand how you can reduce your water, land, and greenhouse gas emission footprint by choosing Impossible products over meat from animals. </p>

                    When we say we’re farm to table, we really mean it. Most of our ingredients come from Italy, where we contract the fields and plant our own crops. Also, we are the manufacturer of our products, with two family owned facilities in Los Angeles and Italy. We handle the food from the fields to the consumer’s hands.
