                What is a Plant-Based Diet?

                    A plant-based diet is a diet consisting mostly or entirely of plant-based foods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The term “plant-based diet” encompasses a wide range of dietary patterns that contain lower amounts of animal products and higher amounts of plant products such as vegetables, fruits, whole cereals, legumes, nuts and seeds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, use of the phrase "plant-based diet" has changed over time and examples can be found of the phrase being used to refer to vegan diets (which only include plant-based food, none from animal sources), and vegetarian diets, which may include dairy or eggs but no meat.

                The Rise in Popularity

                    Plant-based diets have seen a huge spike in popularity in the 21st century as people are getting more and more health-conscious. The number of vegetarians, vegans, and people that wish not to consume animal-source foods is also steadily increasing every year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of the early 21st century, it was estimated that 4 billion people live primarily on a plant-based diet, some by choice and some because of limits caused by shortages of crops, fresh water, and energy resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Europe, consumption of plant-based meat substitutes made up 40% of the world market in 2019 and is forecast to grow by 60% through 2025, due mainly to concerns for health, food security, and animal welfare.

                Is it healthy?

                <p>
                    A plant-based diet isn’t automatically healthy. Too much saturated fat, sugar and salt from any source isn’t good for your health. There are plenty of processed plant-based meals and snacks like sweet potato fries, vegetarian nuggets and fruit bars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is still important to choose whole, less processed foods that are as close to how they are found in nature as possible (e.g. whole vegetables and fruit, legumes, nuts and seeds).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that well-planned plant-based diets support health and are appropriate throughout all life stages, including pregnancy, lactation, childhood, and adulthood, as well as for athletes.
